      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, my name is Faiz and I am an avid writer. Writing has been my passion since I was young and I have been working hard to improve my skills ever since. As a 21-year-old writer, I am constantly exploring new worlds through my words. With a passion for storytelling and a desire to make a difference through my writing, I am dedicated to crafting compelling narratives that resonate with readers. Through my work, I hope to inspire and connect with people from all walks of life, and share my unique perspective with the world. Whether through fiction or non-fiction, I strive to create content that is both engaging and impactful. Join me on this journey as I continue to grow and develop as a writer.!</p>

    <section id="Techniques">
      <h2>My favourite writing techniques</h2>
      <p>Here are five important writing techniques:

(1) Show, don't tell: This technique encourages writers to use descriptive language and sensory details to create a vivid picture in the reader's mind, rather than simply stating facts.

(2)Use active voice: Writing in active voice makes sentences more engaging and helps the reader to focus on the action rather than the subject.

(3) Avoid cliches: Cliches are overused phrases that have lost their original impact. Instead, try to come up with fresh and original ways of expressing your ideas.

(4) Use dialogue effectively: Dialogue can be a powerful tool for revealing character and advancing the plot. It's important to use it sparingly and make sure that each line serves a purpose.

(5) Edit, edit, edit: Writing is a process of revision, and it's important to go back over your work and make sure that every word and sentence is pulling its weight. Eliminate unnecessary words, tighten up your prose, and make sure that your ideas are clear and well-organized.</p>
